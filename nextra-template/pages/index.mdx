# What is Colyseus Multiplayer Framework?

Colyseus is a framework for writing your own authoritative multiplayer game servers using JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js, and easily integrating it with your favorite game engine.

-  [**<PeopleIcon /> Match-making into Rooms**](/server/room) – From a single Room definition, clients are matched into multiple Room instances.
- [**<SyncIcon /> State Synchronization**](/state) – Automatically synchronize the state from the server with connected clients.
- [**<ServerIcon /> Scalable**](/deployment/scalability) – Built for horizontal and/or vertical scalability.
- [**<CloudIcon /> Cloud agnostic**](/deployment) – You may self-host it on your own servers for free, or use our commercial [Colyseus Cloud](https://cloud.colyseus.io/) service.

## System Requirements

Before we start, let's make sure you have the necessary system requirements installed in your local machine.

- [<DownloadIcon /> Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version
- [<DownloadIcon /> Download and Install Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [<DownloadIcon /> Download and Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or other editor of your choice)

## How does it look like?

<Steps>

### Create a server (Node.js or Bun)

Create and start a new Colyseus server using the following commands:

<Tabs items={['Node.js', 'Bun']}>

  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="Terminal: Node.js"
# Create a new Colyseus project
npm create colyseus-app@latest ./my-server

# Enter the project directory
cd my-server

# Run the server
npm start
```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
```sh filename="Terminal: Bun"
# Create a new Colyseus project
bunx create-colyseus-app@latest ./my-server

# Enter the project directory
cd my-server

# Install Bun transport & Run the server
bun add @colyseus/bun-websockets
bun run src/index.ts
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create your Room class

Within your Room code, you will define the game logic and how clients interact with the game state:

```ts copy filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
import { Room, Client } from "@colyseus/core";
import { MyState, Player } from "./MyState";

export class MyRoom extends Room {
    maxClients = 4;
    state = new MyState();

    // Called when the room is created
    onCreate(options) { }

    // Called when a client joins the room
    onJoin(client: Client, options: any) {
        this.state.players.set(client.sessionId, new Player());
    }

    // Called when a client leaves the room
    onLeave(client: Client, options: any) {
        this.state.players.delete(client.sessionId);
    }

    // Called when the room is disposed
    onDispose() { }
}
```

### Expose the Room identifier

By exposing the room type, you can connect to the server and dynamically create instances of this room type:

```ts {6} copy filename="src/app.config.ts"
import config from "@colyseus/tools";
import { MyRoom } from "./MyRoom";

export default config({
    initializeGameServer: (gameServer) => {
        gameServer.define('my_room', MyRoom);
    },
});
```

### Join the Room from the client SDK

Communication between client and server is done via room connections. In the following example, we're using the JavaScript SDK to make the client join a room and listen to state changes:

```ts copy filename="client.ts"
import { Client, getStateCallbacks } from 'colyseus.js';

async function connect() {
    const client = new Client('http://localhost:2567');
    const room = await client.joinOrCreate('my_room', {
        /* custom join options */
    });
    const $ = getStateCallbacks(room);

    // Listen to 'player' instance additions
    $(room.state).players.onAdd((player, sessionId) => {
        console.log('Player joined:', player);
    });

    // Listen to 'player' instance removals
    $(room.state).players.onRemove((player, sessionId) => {
        console.log('Player left:', player);
    });

    return room;
}

connect();
```
