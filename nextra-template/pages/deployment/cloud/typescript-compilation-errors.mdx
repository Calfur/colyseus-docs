# TypeScript/Compilation errors

If you haven't created your Colyseus application via `npm create colyseus-app@latest`, make sure your `tsconfig.json` is configured as follows:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "build",
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "allowJs": true,
    "strictNullChecks": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "useDefineForClassFields": false
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```

Make sure you are able to compile your application locally before deploying it to Colyseus Cloud:

```sh filename="Terminal"
npm run build
```

## Disabling TypeScript strict mode (not recommended)

You can disable TypeScript strict mode by modifying the following configuration to your `tsconfig.json`. (This is not recommend as it will make your application more prone to runtime errors.)

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "strict": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
  }
}
```

## Monorepo setup (advanced)

If you are using a monorepo setup, we recommend using the `pnpm` package manager instead of `npm`. (See [pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) for more information)

```sh filename="Terminal"
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Configure your workspaces

`pnpm` requires you to configure your workspaces in a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file. See example below:

```yaml filename="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
packages:
  # all packages in direct subdirs of packages/
  - 'packages/*'
  # all packages in subdirs of components/
  - 'components/**'
  # exclude packages that are inside test directories
  - '!**/test/**'
```

#### Installing dependencies

Before installing your dependencies with `pnpm`, make sure to remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` from your previous package manager from your project.

```sh filename="Terminal"
pnpm install
```

**Push `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**

Make sure to push the `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` files to your repository, so Colyseus Cloud can install your dependencies correctly.
