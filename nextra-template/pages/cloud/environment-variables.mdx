# Environment Variables and Secrets

Colyseus Cloud allows you to safely store your secrets and environment variables via Application Settings page:

![Environment Variables](/cloud/environment-variables.png)

Values are encrypted and only visible to team members of your application.

<Callout type="warning">
    **Do not commit your secrets to your repository** - When you commit a secret key to your repository, it is exposed to anyone with access to your repository. This can lead to your account being compromised, and your keys being used maliciously.
</Callout>

### Development and Production environments

Colyseus loads your `.env` files automatically, depending on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. The usage of `.env` files is optional.

- `.env.development`: When testing from your local machine
- `.env.production`: When deployed to Colyseus Cloud
- `.env.{REGION}.production`: When deployed to Colyseus Cloud, depending on the region where your server has been provisioned. Region-based environment variables have precedence over `.env.production`.

### Region-based Environment Variables

Colyseus Cloud provides region-based environment variables, depending on where your application is deployed:

- `process.env.REGION` - the region where your server has been provisioned.
- `process.env.COUNTRY` - the country where your server has been provisioned.
