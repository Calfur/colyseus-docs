## Overview: How State Synchronization Works?

- When the client joins a room, it receives the full encoded state from the server.
- State mutations on the server-side are enqueued at a per-property level. Only the _last mutation_ of each property will be transmitted.
- Enqueued mutations are binary-encoded and sent to clients at every [patchRate](/server/room/#patchrate-number) interval, and then cleared.
- The [schema callbacks](/state/callbacks) are triggered on the client-side **after** patches have been applied locally.

<Steps>
	### State is defined on the server-side

    Define your state structures by extending `Schema` class from `@colyseus/schema`:

    ```ts filename="MyState.ts"
    import { Schema, type } from "@colyseus/schema";

    export class Player extends Schema {
        @type("string") name: string;
        @type("number") x: number;
        @type("number") y: number;
    }

    export class MyState extends Schema {
        @type({ map: Player }) players = new MapSchema<Player>();
    }
    ```

    ### State is set on the Room

    Set the state on the Room instance:

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    import { Room } from "colyseus";
    import { MyState } from "./MyState";

    export class MyRoom extends Room<MyState> {
        state = new MyState();
    }
    ```

    ### State is synchronized with clients

    Whenever a mutation occurs in the server-side, the state is automatically synchronized with all clients in the room. Clients receive the full state when they join the room.

    ```ts copy filename="client.ts"
    import { Client, getStateCallbacks } from 'colyseus.js';

    // ...
    const client = new Client('http://localhost:2567');
    const room = await client.joinOrCreate('my_room', {/* */});
    const $ = getStateCallbacks(room);

    // Listen to 'player' instance additions
    $(room.state).players.onAdd((player, sessionId) => {
        console.log('Player joined:', player);
    });

    // Listen to 'player' instance removals
    $(room.state).players.onRemove((player, sessionId) => {
        console.log('Player left:', player);
    });
    ```

</Steps>

TODO: review this section

- [**Schema definitions**](/state/schema) – define your state structure using Colyseus' `Schema` class.
- [**Client-side callbacks**](/state/callbacks) – listen to state changes on the client-side.

## How state synchronization works

- When the client joins a room, it receives the full encoded state from the server.
- State mutations on the server-side are enqueued at a per-property level. (Only the last mutation of each property is kept)
- Enqueued mutations are binary-encoded and sent to **all clients** at every [patchRate](/server/room/#patchrate-number) interval, and then cleared.
- Client-side [schema callbacks](/state/callbacks) are triggered after patches were applied.

## Working with schema structures

- Only the server-side is responsible for mutating schema structures
- The client-side must have the same `Schema` definitions generated through [`schema-codegen`](#client-side-schema-generation). _(Optional if you're using the [JavaScript SDK](/getting-started/javascript-client/))_
- In order to get updates from the server, you need to [attach callbacks on schema instances in the client-side](/state/callbacks).
- The client-side should never perform mutations on schema - as they are going to be replaced as soon as the next change come from the server.
