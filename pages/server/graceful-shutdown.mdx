## Graceful Shutdown Process

Colyseus listens for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals to gracefully shut down the process.

These actions will be performed, in order, before the process is killed:

<Steps>
    ### Server: On Before Shutdown

    The custom `gameServer.onBeforeShutdown()` is called, if defined.

    ```ts filename="app.config.ts"
    gameServer.onBeforeShutdown(async () => {
        // (...) custom logic
    });
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Server API → On Before Shutdown](/server/#onbeforeshutdown)
    </Callout>

    ### Process is excluded from match-making.

    The process is not going to be selected for new room creations anymore.

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Server API → Select Process ID to Create Room](/server#select-process-id-to-create-room)
    </Callout>

    ### Rooms are locked

    The rooms handled by this process are locked via `room.lock()`.

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Room API → Lock Room](/server/room/#lock)
    </Callout>

    ### Room: On Before Shutdown

    All rooms `room.onBeforeShutdown()` is called.

    You may override this method to perform custom actions that will result in the room being disposed in a few minutes. By default, it simply calls `room.disconnect()`, which will trigger `room.onLeave()` for all clients, and then `room.onDispose()` almost immediately.

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    onBeforeShutdown() {
        //
        // Notify users that process is shutting down, they may need to save their progress and join a new room
        //
        this.broadcast("going-down", "Server is shutting down. Please save your progress and join a new room.");

        //
        // Disconnect all clients after 5 minutes
        //
        this.clock.setTimeout(() => this.disconnect(), 5 * 60 * 1000);
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Room API → On Before Shutdown](/server/room/#onbeforeshutdown)
    </Callout>

    ### (...) wait until all rooms are disposed

    The server waits for local room count to be zero before proceeding to the next step.

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Matchmaker → Get Local Room Count](/server/matchmaker#get-local-ccu)
    </Callout>

    ### Close Transport, Presence, and Driver

    The [Transport](/server/transport), [Presence](/server/presence), and [Driver](/server/driver) are closed and disconnected.

    ### Server: On Shutdown

    The custom `gameServer.onShutdown()` is called, if defined.

    At this point there is no more rooms or clients connected to the server.

    ```ts filename="app.config.ts"
    gameServer.onShutdown(async () => {
        // (...) custom logic
    });
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
        See [Server API → On Shutdown](/server/#onshutdown)
    </Callout>

    ### Process is killed

    The process is killed after all the steps above are completed.
</Steps>

You may use `async` functions or return a `Promise` to perform asynchronous operations on `onLeave` and `onDispose` methods, as well as `gameServer.onBeforeShutdown()` and `gameServer.onShutdown()`.

        By returning a `Promise`, the server will wait for them to be completed before killing the worker process.

        ```ts {5,17} filename="MyRoom.ts"
        import { Room } from "colyseus";

        class MyRoom extends Room {
            onLeave (client) {
                return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    doDatabaseOperation((err, data) => {
                        if (err) {
                            reject(err);
                        } else {
                            resolve(data);
                        }
                    });
                });
            }

            onDispose () {
                return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                    doDatabaseOperation((err, data) => {
                        if (err) {
                            reject(err);
                        } else {
                            resolve(data);
                        }
                    });
                });
            }
        }
        ```

        The `async` keyword will make your function return a `Promise` under the hood. [Read more about Async / Await](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/future-javascript/async-await).

                await doDatabaseOperation(client);
