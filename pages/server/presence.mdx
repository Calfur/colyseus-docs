# Presence API

When you need to scale your server on multiple processes and/or machines, you'd need to provide the [`Presence`](/server/#optionspresence) option to the `Server`. The purpose of `Presence` is to allow communicating and sharing data between different processes, specially during match-making.

- [`LocalPresence`](#localpresence) (default)
- [`RedisPresence`](#redispresence-clientopts)

The `presence` instance is also available on every `Room` handler. You may use its [API](#api) to persist data and communicate between rooms via PUB/SUB.

---

## `LocalPresence`

This is the default option. It's meant to be used when you're running Colyseus in a single process.

---

## `RedisPresence`

Use this option when you're running Colyseus on multiple processes and/or machines.

**Constructor parameters:**

- `clientOpts`: The redis client options (host/credentials). [See full list of options](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/2e6f3e603a01589534cb5f6197849a6bc8ca71dc/types/ioredis/index.d.ts#L1997-L2160).

        presence: new RedisPresence(process.env.REDIS_URI)
    });

    gameServer.listen(2567);
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

## API

The `Presence` API is highly based on Redis's API, which is a key-value database.

Every [`Room`](/server/room) instance has a [`presence`](/server/room/#presence-presence) property:

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
export class MyRoom extends Room {
    onCreate() {
        this.presence // full Presence API is available from here
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can access `matchMaker.presence` from anywhere, by importing the [Match-maker API](/server/matchmaker/):

```ts filename="server.ts"
import { matchMaker } from "colyseus";

matchMaker.presence // full Presence API is available from here
```

---

### Subscribe

Subscribes to the given `topic`. The `callback` will be triggered whenever a message is [published](#publishtopic-string-data-any) on `topic`.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.subscribe(topic: string, callback: Function)
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
this.presence.subscribe("global-event", (data) => {
    console.log("received message:", data);
});
```

---

### Unsubscribe

Unsubscribe from given `topic`.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.unsubscribe(topic: string, callback?: Function)
```

<Tabs items={["Unsubscribe from all", "Unsubscribe from specific callback"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Unsubscribe from all previously subscribed "global-event" callbacks.

    ```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
    //
    this.presence.unsubscribe("global-event");
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    Unsubscribe from a specific "topic" callback.

    ``` typescript
    function callback(data) { }
    this.presence.subscribe("global-event", callback);

    // unsubscribing from specific callback
    this.presence.unsubscribe("global-event", callback);
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>



---

### Publish

Posts a message to given `topic`.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.publish(topic: string, data: any)
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
this.presence.publish("global-event", { any: 1, data: 2, here: "3" });
```

---

### Set

Set key to hold the string value.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.set(key: string, value: string)
```

**Example:** Setting a `"global-key"` to hold `"a string value"`.

``` typescript
this.presence.set("global-key", "a string value");
```

---

### Set with expiration

Set key to hold the string value and set key to timeout after a given number of seconds.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.setex(key: string, value: string, seconds: number)
```

**Example:** Setting a `"global-key"` that is globally available for 2 minutes.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
this.presence.setex("global-key", "a string value", 120);
```

---

### Get the value of key

Get the value of key.

```ts filename="Signature"

```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
const globalKeyValue = await this.presence.get("global-key");
```

---

### Delete the key

Removes the specified key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.del(key: string): void
```

```

---

### Increment value of key

Increments the number stored at key by one.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.incr(key: string)
```

If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation.

An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer.

This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.incr("global-count");
await this.presence.incr("global-count");
await this.presence.incr("global-count");

// get value from "global-count" key
const count = await this.presence.get("global-count");
console.log(count) // => 3
```

---

### Decrement value of key

Decrements the number stored at key by one.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.decr(key: string)
```

If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation.

An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer.

This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.decr("global-count");
await this.presence.decr("global-count");

console.log(count) // => 33
```

---

### Add members to a Set

Add the specified members to the set stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.sadd(key: string, value: any)
```

Specified members that are already a member of this set are ignored.

If key does not exist, a new set is created before adding the specified members.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-one");
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-one"); // ignored, not added
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-two");
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-three");
```

---

### Get all members of a Set

Returns all the members of the set value stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.smembers(key: string)
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
const globalSetMembers = await this.presence.del("global-set1");
console.log(globalSetMembers) // => ["member-one", "member-two", "member-three"]
```

---

### Check if member is in the Set

Returns if `member` is a member of the set stored at key

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.sismember(key: string, member: string): number
```

**Return value**

- `1` if the element is a member of the set.
- `0` if the element is not a member of the set, or if key does not exist.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
const isMember = await this.presence.sismember("global-set1", "member-three");

if (isMember) {
    console.log("member-three IS present on 'global-set1'");

} else {
    console.log("member-three IS NOT present on 'global-set1'");
}
```

---

### Remove member(s) from a Set

Remove the specified members from the set stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.srem(key: string, value: any)
```

Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored.

If key does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns `0`.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.srem("global-set1", "member-three");
```

---

### Get total members in Set

Returns the set number of elements (cardinality) of the set stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.scard(key: string)
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
const cardinality = await this.presence.scard("global-set1");

console.log(intersection); // => ["member-two"]
```

---

### Set a field in a Hash

Sets field in the hash stored at key to value.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.hset(key: string, field: string, value: string)
```

If key does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

If field already exists in the hash, it is overwritten.

``` typescript
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "1");
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key2", "2");
```

---

### Increment field in a Hash

Increments the number stored at field in the hash stored at key by increment.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.hincrby(key: string, field: string, value: number)
```

If key does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

If field does not exist the value is set to 0 before the operation is performed.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "2");
const incr = await this.presence.hincrby("global-hashmap1", "key1", "5");
console.log(incr) // => "7"

const value = await this.presence.hget("global-hashmap1", "key");
console.log(value) // => "value"
```

---

### Get all fields in a Hash

Returns all fields and values of the hash stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.hgetall(key: string): Promise<{ [field: string]: string }>
```

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "1");
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key2", "2");

const value = await this.presence.hgetall("global-hashmap1");
console.log(value) // => {"key1": "1", "key2": "2"}
```

---

### Delete field in a Hash

Removes the specified field from the hash stored at key.

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.hdel(key: string, field: string): Promise<boolean>
```

Returns `true` if removed, and `false` if key or field does not exist.

```ts filename="MyRoom.ts"
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "1");
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key2", "2");

// delete "key2" from "global-hashmap1".
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key2");
```

---

### Get the length of a Hash

Returns the number of fields contained in the hash stored at key

```ts filename="Signature"
presence.hlen(key: string): Promise<number>
```
