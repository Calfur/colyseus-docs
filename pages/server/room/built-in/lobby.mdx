# Lobby Room

{/*<Callout type="warning">
    Client-side API for lobby room will change on Colyseus 1.0.0
</Callout>*/}

The built-in `LobbyRoom` automatically notify connected clients whenever rooms with "realtime listing" have updates.

## Server

```ts filename="server.ts"
import { LobbyRoom } from "colyseus";

// Expose the "lobby" room.
gameServer
  .define("lobby", LobbyRoom);

// Expose your game room with realtime listing enabled.
gameServer
  .define("your_game", YourGameRoom)
  .enableRealtimeListing();
```

The `LobbyRoom` is notified automatically during `onCreate()`, `onJoin()`, `onLeave()` and `onDispose()`.

### Updating the lobby

If you have [updated the `metadata` of your room](/server/room/#setmetadata-metadata), and need to trigger an update for the lobby, you can call `updateLobby()` right after the metadata has been updated:

```ts filename="YourGameRoom.ts"
import { Room, updateLobby } from "colyseus";

class YourGameRoom extends Room {

  onCreate() {

    //
    // This is just a demonstration
    // on how to call `updateLobby` from your Room
    //
    this.clock.setTimeout(() => {

      this.setMetadata({
        gameMode: "deathmatch",
      }).then(() => updateLobby(this));

    }, 5000);

  }

}
```

## Client

The `LobbyRoom` will send messages to the client whenever a room is added, removed or updated.

```ts {8,12,22} filename="client.ts"
import { Client, RoomAvailable } from "colyseus.js";

const client = new Client("ws://localhost:2567");
const lobby = await client.joinOrCreate("lobby");

let allRooms: RoomAvailable[] = [];

lobby.onMessage("rooms", (rooms) => {
  allRooms = rooms;
});

lobby.onMessage("+", ([roomId, room]) => {
  const roomIndex = allRooms.findIndex((room) => room.roomId === roomId);
  if (roomIndex !== -1) {
    allRooms[roomIndex] = room;

  } else {
    allRooms.push(room);
  }
});

lobby.onMessage("-", (roomId) => {
  allRooms = allRooms.filter((room) => room.roomId !== roomId);
});
```

### Filtering rooms

Filtering rooms by `name` or `metadata` can be done by providing the `filter` option when joining the lobby:

```ts {1-6} filename="client.ts"
const lobby = await client.joinOrCreate("lobby", {
  filter: {
    name: "my_room",
    metadata: {
      gameMode: "deathmatch",
    }
  }
});
```

Alternatively, you can also dynamically change the filter by sending a `"filter"` message to the lobby room:

```ts
lobby.send("filter", {
  name: "my_room",
  metadata: {
    gameMode: "deathmatch",
  }
});
```
