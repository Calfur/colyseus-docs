Deploying Colyseus is no different than deploying a regular Node.js application - [see a good article here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-20-04).

However, scaling Colyseus to use multiple processes requires extra steps. See [Deployment â†’ Scalability](/deployment/scalability).

# Deploying your Colyseus server

- [Colyseus Cloud](/deployment/cloud)
- [Self-hosting on Vultr](#self-hosting-on-vultr)
- [Nginx configuration](#nginx-configuration)
- [Apache configuration](#apache-configuration)
- [Docker](#docker)
- [Heroku](#heroku)

## Self-hosting on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9632185-9J)

{/*
https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8013231
https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/apps/colyseus/?ref=8013231
*/}

A pre-configured Colyseus server is available on [Vultr Marketplace](https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/apps/colyseus/?ref=9632185-9J). It's a good option if you want to self-host your Colyseus server.

This server is configured with:

- Node.js LTS
- PM2
- Nginx
- FREE `colyseus.dev` subdomain with SSL (Let's Encrypt)

Follow the instructions at Vultr Marketplace to get your server up and running.

---

## Nginx configuration

When self-hosting, it is recommended to use `nginx` and `pm2` in your production environment.

### Nginx configuration

```conf filename="/etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com"
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:2567;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
        include proxy_params;
    }
}
```

### Nginx configuration with SSL

It's recommended to acquire your certificate from [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

```conf filename="/etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com"
server {
    listen 80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/cert.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:2567;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
        include proxy_params;
    }
}
```

## Apache configuration

Here's how to use Apache as a proxy to your Node.js Colyseus app. (Thanks [tomkleine](https://github.com/tomkleine)!)

Install the required Apache modules:

```sh filename="Terminal"
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_html
sudo a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
```

Virtual host configuration:

```conf filename="/etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.com.conf"
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName servername.xyz
    # Redirect all requests received from port 80 to the HTTPS variant (force ssl)
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName servername.xyz

    # enable SSL
    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile          /PATH/TO/CERT/FILE
    SSLCertificateKeyFile       /PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY/FILE

    #
    # setup the proxy to forward websocket requests properly to a normal websocket
    # and vice versa, so there's no need to change the colyseus library or the
    # server for that matter
    #
    # note: this proxy automatically converts the secure websocket (wss)

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:UPGRADE} ^WebSocket$           [NC,OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} ^Upgrade$          [NC]
    RewriteRule .* ws://127.0.0.1:APP-PORT-HERE%{REQUEST_URI}  [P,QSA,L]

    # setup the proxy to forward all https requests to http backend
    # (also automatic conversion from https to http and vice versa)

    ProxyPass "/" "http://localhost:APP-PORT-HERE/"
    ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://localhost:APP-PORT-HERE/"

</VirtualHost>
```

## Docker

### Requirements

- Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in the project.
- Set up the `npm start` command so it starts the server

<Steps>
### Create `Dockerfile` in the root of the Colyseus project

```dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"
FROM node:22

ENV PORT 8080

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm ci
# run this for production
# npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

### Create `.dockerignore` file in the same directory

```txt filename=".dockerignore"
node_modules
npm-debug.log
```

This will prevent your local modules and debug logs from being copied onto your Docker image and possibly overwriting modules installed within your image.

### Build Docker Image

Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image. The -t flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later using the docker images command:

```sh filename="Terminal"
docker build -t <your username>/colyseus-server .
```

### Confirm Image Build

Your image will now be listed by Docker with following command:

```sh filename="Terminal"
docker images
```

Output:

```txt
# Example
REPOSITORY                      TAG        ID              CREATED
node                            14         1934b0b038d1    About a minute ago
<your username>/colseus-server    latest     d64d3505b0d2    About a minute ago
```

### Run the Docker Image

Run the Docker Image with following command:

```sh filename="Terminal"
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d <your username>/colyseus-server
```

Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container.

### Done

Done, now you can connect to the server with `localhost:8080`

</Steps>

## Heroku

Heroku can be used for prototyping. You can deploy the [colyseus-examples](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-examples) project on it by hitting this button:

Keep in mind that scaling to multiple processes and/or nodes on Heroku is not supported out of the box, therefore we don't recommend using it in a production environment.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-examples)

**Important:** Make sure to set the environment variable `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` in order to use dev-dependencies in your deployment.
