# Room Authentication

You can authenticate your users using the `onAuth` method in your room. This method is called before `onJoin`, and it is responsible for validating the client's request to join a room.

- If `onAuth()` returns a [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) value, `onJoin()` is going to be called with the returned value as the third argument.
- If `onAuth()` returns a [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) value, the client is immediatelly rejected, causing the matchmaking function call from the client-side to fail.
- You may also throw a `ServerError` to expose a custom error to be handled in the client-side.

If left non-implemented, it always returns `true` - allowing any client to connect.

<Steps>

## Server-side: `onAuth` method

<Tabs items={["Static onAuth (recommended)", "Instance onAuth"]}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    The `static onAuth` is recommended because it does not require the room instance to be created before authenticating the client.



    <Callout type="info">
        If you need to access the room instance during the authentication process, you can use the instance `onAuth` method instance.
    </Callout>

    ```ts {5} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
    import { Room } from "colyseus";
    import { JWT } from "@colyseus/auth";

    class MyRoom extends Room {
        static async onAuth (token, options, context) {
            // validate the token
            const userdata = await JWT.verify(token);

            // return userdata
            return userdata;
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
    The instance `onAuth` method is called after the room instance is created. This method is useful when you need to access the room instance properties, such as currently connected clients, or the room state.

    <Callout type="info">
        If you don't need to access the room instance properties, it's recommended to use the static `onAuth` method instead.
    </Callout>

    ```ts {5} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
    import { Room } from "colyseus";
    import { JWT } from "@colyseus/auth";

    class MyRoom extends Room {
        async onAuth (client, options, context) {
            // validate the token
            const userdata = await JWT.verify(context.token);

            // return userdata
            return userdata;
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Server-side: `onJoin` method

Get the user data during the `onJoin` method via the `client.auth` property.

```ts {5} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
import { Room } from "colyseus";
// ...
class MyRoom extends Room {
    // ...
    async onJoin (client, options) {
        client.auth // contains the userdata
    }
}
```

## Client-side: Setting the auth token

The `client.auth.token` property is used to set the authentication token. This token will be sent as an `Authorization` header in all HTTP requests to the server.

```js filename="client.js"
// set the auth token
client.auth.token = "YOUR AUTH TOKEN";
```

<Callout type="info">
    If you are using the `@colyseus/auth` module, this token is managed automatically. See [Authentication â†’ Module](/auth/module).
</Callout>

## Client-side: Requesting to join a Room

Match-making requests will contain the auth token.

```js filename="client.js"
client.joinOrCreate("my_room").then((room) => {
    console.log(room);
});
```

</Steps>

## `onAuth` Context

The third argument of the `onAuth` method is the `context` object. Both `static onAuth` and `onAuth` methods receive the same `context` object as the third argument.

The `context` object has the following properties:

- `token` - the authentication token sent by the client.
- `headers` - the headers sent by the client.
- `ip` - the IP address of the client.

### Accessing the Auth Token

The authentication token is available in the `context.token` property.

```ts {3} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
// ...
async onAuth(client, options, context) {
    console.log(context.token);
}
// ...
```

### Accessing the request headers

The request headers are available in the `context.headers` property.

```ts {3} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
// ...
async onAuth(client, options, context) {
    console.log(context.headers);
}
// ...
```

### Accessing the client IP address

The client IP address is available in the `context.ip` property.

```ts {3} filename="src/rooms/MyRoom.ts"
// ...
async onAuth(client, options, context) {
    console.log(context.ip);
}
// ...
```

It contains the value of the `X-Real-IP` header, if available. If not, it falls back to the `X-Forwarded-For` header, and finally to the request object's `remoteAddress` property.
