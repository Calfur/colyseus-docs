# Continuous Deployment

## Using GitHub Actions

When you make your first deployment from your development environment to the Colyseus Cloud, you will receive a `.colyseus-cloud.json` file. This file contains the `applicationId` and `token` that you will use to deploy your server from your CI/CD pipeline.

It is **not recommended** to push `.colyseus-cloud.json` to your repository, as it contains sensitive information. Instead, you can use GitHub Secrets to store this information and use it in your GitHub Actions workflow:

- `APPLICATION_ID`: The `applicationId` from your `.colyseus-cloud.json` file.
- `TOKEN`: The `token` from your `.colyseus-cloud.json` file.

## Example Workflow

Here is an example of a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys your server to the Colyseus Cloud when you push to the `main` branch.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/colyseus-cloud-deploy.yml"
name: Deploy to Colyseus Cloud

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
            applicationId: ${{ secrets.APPLICATION_ID }}
            token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Use Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v4
              with:
                  node-version: '20.x'
                  registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
            - name: Trigger deployment
              run: |
                  npm install -g @colyseus/cloud
                  npx @colyseus/cloud deploy --applicationId $applicationId --token $token
```
