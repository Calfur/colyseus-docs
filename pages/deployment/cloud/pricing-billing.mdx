# Pricing & Billing

> See the [Pricing Simulator](https://colyseus.io/pricing/) for more details.

Colyseus Cloud uses a subscription-based billing model with upfront provisioning and proration for flexibility.

When you provision a server instance, the cost for the selected compute plan is charged upfront for the billing cycle (monthly).

If you delete an instance before the end of the billing cycle, the unused time is credited to your account. These credits are automatically applied to your next invoice, reducing your costs.

If you provision an instance for $100/month and delete it after 15 days, 50% of the instance cost ($50) is credited for use on future deployments.
