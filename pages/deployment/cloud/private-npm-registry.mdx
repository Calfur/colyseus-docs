# Private NPM Registry

If you rely on private NPM packages from your organization, you need to configure authentication to access them during deployment. This is done by creating a local `~/.npmrc` file in your project root.

## Example: Private NPM Registry from GitHub

For packages published under your GitHub organization (e.g., `@your-company/package-name`):

```txt filename=".npmrc"
@your-org-name:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

**Configuration steps:**

1. Replace `@your-org-name` with your actual GitHub organization or username
2. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with your GitHub personal access token that has `read:packages` permission
3. Place this `.npmrc` file in your project root directory

This configuration tells npm to use GitHub's package registry for all packages under your organization's scope, while using the default npm registry for all other packages.
