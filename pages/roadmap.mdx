# Roadmap: Colyseus v1.0

<Callout type="info">
    If you'd like to support the project towards v1.0, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/endel) my work.
</Callout>

_This page has a list of features and improvements for future versions of Colyseus. The order of items does not reflect their priority or importance._

## General improvements
- Add request/response model to rooms ([#331](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus/issues/331))
- Client input validation API (`onMessage` in the server)
- Introduce "version check" to allow native SDKs to communicate with newer versions of the server

## Database
- Introduce an official database recommendation tool. The recommendation should be used on the documentation, official examples, and initial template project. (See [<DatabaseIcon/> Database](/database))

## Matchmaking
- SQL Driver: Provide a SQL driver as alternative to `@colyseus/redis-driver` (should support SQLite / PostgreSQL, possibly on top of Kysely)
- Improve filtering and sorting options

### Introduce new "queue" matchmaking type
- A queue would keep more clients than needed before starting a match
- User specifies logic that combines clients into a new room
- Reserve seats for selected clients and redirect them to the newly created room

## Full-stack TypeScript
- Allow to infer types for room message and payload definitions from client-side (`room.send()`)
- Allow to infer http routes and request/response body types from client-side (`client.http.*`)

## State Sync / `@colyseus/schema`

### Bidirectional schema instances
- Allow to send schema instance updates from client to server
- Wild idea: support RPC calls via schema instances (?)

### "Netcode" / Client-side prediction
- Allow to specify client-side prediction techniques on the client-side (?)

## WebTransport
- Improve and stabilize [WebTransport](/server/transport/webtransport) support

## More SDKs
- Fork and support a Godot SDK ([gsioteam/godot-colyseus](https://github.com/gsioteam/godot-colyseus))
