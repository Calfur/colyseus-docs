# Best Practices

## Limitations and Best practices

- Each `Schema` structure can hold up to `64` serialized fields. If you need more fields, use nested `Schema` structures.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` are encoded as `0` (integer encoding only)
- `null` strings are encoded as `""` (both "string" and "cstring" encoding)
- Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported. [See how to use 1D arrays as multi-dimensional](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/212808/treating-a-1d-data-structure-as-2d-grid/212813#212813)
- `@colyseus/schema` encoding order is based on field definition order.
    - Both encoder (server) and decoder (client) must have same schema definition.
    - The order of the fields must be the same.
