# State Handling

The room handlers are **stateful** in Colyseus. Each room holds its own state. The mutations of the state are synchronized automatically to all connected clients.

## Serialization methods

- [Schema](/state/schema/) (default)
- [Fossil Delta](/state/fossil-delta/) (deprecated)

## When the state is synchronized

- When the user successfully joins the room, he receives the full state from the server.
- At every [patchRate](/server/room/#patchrate-number), binary patches of the state are sent to every client (default is `50ms`)
- [`onStateChange`](/client/room/#onstatechange) is called in the client-side after every patch received from the server.
- Each serialization method has it's own particular way to handle incoming state patches.
