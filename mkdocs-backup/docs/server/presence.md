# Server API &raquo; Presence

When you need to scale your server on multiple processes and/or machines, you'd need to provide the [`Presence`](/server/api/#optionspresence) option to the `Server`. The purpose of `Presence` is to allow communicating and sharing data between different processes, specially during match-making.

- [`LocalPresence`](#localpresence) (default)
- [`RedisPresence`](#redispresence-clientopts)

The `presence` instance is also available on every `Room` handler. You may use its [API](#api) to persist data and communicate between rooms via PUB/SUB.

---

### `LocalPresence`

This is the default option. It's meant to be used when you're running Colyseus in a single process.

---

### `RedisPresence (clientOpts?)`

Use this option when you're running Colyseus on multiple processes and/or machines.

**Parameters:**

- `clientOpts`: The redis client options (host/credentials). [See full list of options](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/2e6f3e603a01589534cb5f6197849a6bc8ca71dc/types/ioredis/index.d.ts#L1997-L2160).

=== "app.config.ts"

    ``` typescript
    import config from "@colyseus/tools";
    import { RedisPresence } from "@colyseus/redis-presence";

    export default config({
        // ...
        options: {
            presence: new RedisPresence()
        },
        // ...
    });
    ```


=== "TypeScript"

    ``` typescript
    import { Server } from "colyseus";
    import { RedisPresence } from "@colyseus/redis-presence";

    // This happens on the slave processes.
    const gameServer = new Server({
        // ...
        presence: new RedisPresence()
    });

    gameServer.listen(2567);
    ```

=== "JavaScript"

    ``` typescript
    const colyseus = require('colyseus');
    const RedisPresence = require('@colyseus/redis-presence').RedisPresence;

    // This happens on the slave processes.
    const gameServer = new colyseus.Server({
        // ...
        presence: new RedisPresence()
    });

    gameServer.listen(2567);
    ```

---

## API

The `Presence` API is highly based on Redis's API, which is a key-value database.

Every [`Room`](/server/room) instance has a [`presence`](/server/room/#presence-presence) property:

``` typescript
export class MyRoom extends Room {
    onCreate() {
        this.presence // full Presence API is available from here
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can access `matchMaker.presence` from anywhere, by importing the [Match-maker API](/server/matchmaker/):

``` typescript
import { matchMaker } from "colyseus";

matchMaker.presence // full Presence API is available from here
```

---

### `subscribe(topic: string, callback: Function)`

Subscribes to the given `topic`. The `callback` will be triggered whenever a message is [published](#publishtopic-string-data-any) on `topic`.

``` typescript
this.presence.subscribe("global-event", (data) => {
    console.log("received message:", data);
});
```

---

### `unsubscribe(topic: string, callback?: Function)`

Unsubscribe from given `topic`.

**Example:** Unsubscribe from all previously subscribed "global-event" callbacks.

``` typescript
//
this.presence.unsubscribe("global-event");
```

**Example:** Unsubscribe from a specific "topic" callback.

``` typescript
function callback(data) { }
this.presence.subscribe("global-event", callback);

// unsubscribing from specific callback
this.presence.unsubscribe("global-event", callback);
```

---

### `publish(topic: string, data: any)`

Posts a message to given `topic`.

``` typescript
this.presence.publish("global-event", { any: 1, data: 2, here: "3" });
```

---

### `set(key: string, value: string)`

Set key to hold the string value.

**Example:** Setting a `"global-key"` to hold `"a string value"`.

``` typescript
this.presence.set("global-key", "a string value");
```

---

### `setex(key: string, value: string, seconds: number)`

Set key to hold the string value and set key to timeout after a given number of seconds.

**Example:** Setting a `"global-key"` that is globally available for 2 minutes.

``` typescript
this.presence.setex("global-key", "a string value", 120);
```

---

### `get(key: string)`

Get the value of key.

``` typescript

---

### `exists(key: string): Promise<boolean>`

Returns if key exists.

``` typescript
const globalKeyExists = await this.presence.exists("global-key");
```

---

### `incr(key: string)`

Increments the number stored at key by one.

If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation.

An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer.

This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

``` typescript
await this.presence.incr("global-count");
await this.presence.incr("global-count");
await this.presence.incr("global-count");

// get value from "global-count" key
const count = await this.presence.get("global-count");
console.log(count) // => 3
```

---

### `decr(key: string)`

Decrements the number stored at key by one.

If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation.

An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer.

This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

``` typescript
await this.presence.decr("global-count");
await this.presence.decr("global-count");
await this.presence.decr("global-count");

// get value from "global-count" key
const count = await this.presence.get("global-count");
console.log(count) // => 33
```

---

### `sadd(key: string, value: any)`

Add the specified members to the set stored at key.

Specified members that are already a member of this set are ignored.

If key does not exist, a new set is created before adding the specified members.

``` typescript
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-one");
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-one"); // ignored, not added
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-two");

console.log(globalSetMembers) // => ["member-one", "member-two", "member-three"]
```

---

### `sismember(key: string, member: string)`

Returns if `member` is a member of the set stored at key

**Return value**

- `1` if the element is a member of the set.
- `0` if the element is not a member of the set, or if key does not exist.

``` typescript
const isMember = await this.presence.sismember("global-set1", "member-three");

if (isMember) {
    console.log("member-three IS present on 'global-set1'");

} else {
    console.log("member-three IS NOT present on 'global-set1'");
}
```

---

### `srem(key: string, value: any)`

Remove the specified members from the set stored at key.

Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored.

If key does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns `0`.

``` typescript
await this.presence.srem("global-set1", "member-three");
```

---

### `scard(key: string)`

Returns the set number of elements (cardinality) of the set stored at key.

``` typescript
const cardinality = await this.presence.scard("global-set1");
console.log(cardinality) // => 2
```

---

### `sinter(...keys: string[])`

Returns the members of the set resulting from the intersection of all the given sets.

``` typescript
// add members to "global-set1"
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-one");
await this.presence.sadd("global-set1", "member-two");

// add members to "global-set2"
await this.presence.sadd("global-set2", "member-two");

await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "1");
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key2", "2");
```

---

### `hincrby(key: string, field: string, value: number)`

Increments the number stored at field in the hash stored at key by increment.

If key does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created.

If field does not exist the value is set to 0 before the operation is performed.

``` typescript
await this.presence.hset("global-hashmap1", "key1", "2");
const incr = await this.presence.hincrby("global-hashmap1", "key1", "5");
