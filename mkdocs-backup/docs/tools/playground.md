# Playground

The client-side playground allows to easily create connections with rooms and inspect how they communicate with the server.

## Features

- Lists all your defined room types
- Allows to `joinOrCreate` / `create` / `join` into them.
- When `joinById` is selected, provides a list of active rooms by id
- Visualize the client state in JSON format
- Table of incoming and outgoing messages
- Table of raw events from the framework
- Allow the client to send messages by type (auto-detected)

You can also interactively test how your room behaves during a dropped connection versus when a client leaves the room consensually.

## Installation

The playground is installed by default on new projects created via `npm create colyseus-app`.

To manually install on an existing project, please do:

```bash
npm install --save @colyseus/playground
```

Then, import and bind it to your express app instance:

```typescript
// import the route
import { playground } from "@colyseus/playground";

// bind it as an express middleware
app.use("/playground", playground());
```
